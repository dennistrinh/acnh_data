# Animal Crossing New Horizons Data
A project to test out some features of AWS as well as explore some web technologies while I'm at it.

## Current Functionality

- Filter bugs, fish, and sea creatures by month
- See currently active bugs, fish, and sea creatures (and by timezone)

## Todos
- More filters (price, shadow size, etc)
- Southern Hemisphere data needs to be added
