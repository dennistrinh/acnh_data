    <h3>May 22nd, 2020: Messing around with continuous integration</h3>
    <p>I've been poking around at CI tooling. I'm trying to setup a Jenkins
       pipeline to automatically build my Docker image, but I'm having a little trouble
       understanding some of the documentation. Needs a bit more research and YouTube
       video searching. On the other hand, I still need to refactor the Express requests
       for reusability. Speaking of reusability, this blog page should be a React module,
       so I don't have to copy and paste the html over and over. Many things to do.
       Fun times ahead.

    <h3>May 19th, 2020: Tables updated with more info</h3>
    <p>I wonder what happened to my first certificate, but it didn't seem to go through.
       I reissued a new certificate with Certbot and it seems to be set up correctly.
       All my HTTP requests now automatically redirect to HTTPS as well. Got the cool
       little lock next to my domain name. I still need to figure out how to do that
       second table though.

    <h3>May 18th, 2020: Tables updated with more info</h3>
    <p>Times and shadow sizes are up. HTTPS should also be set up soon once the certificate
       gets validated. I still have to figure out how to get two tables up at the same time.
       I could run two queries in one statement, but nodejs highly recommends against it as
       it is a security risk. Hmm.

    <h3>May 14th, 2020: Images are up. Basic filtering also working.</h3>
    <p>160 images all in. Had to do some formatting with the SQL names to render the images correctly.
       At the moment, it is possible to filter to see which new bugs and fish are catchable in a month.
       Biggest problem today: Converting the user's month input to SQL readable input then passing that
       to the query. My solution was to create a separate module that translates the user's input then
       returns a complete SQL statement ready to use for querying. Locations are also in. 
       I need to add a separate table for bugs and fish that continue to spawn
       in a new month. Times for spawns also need to be added. Table CSS needs some work (some
       of the tables resize strangely).

    <p>Using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Let's see if I can get node to see my RDS database."
       It seems to be mad at me for some connection timeout reason. Possibly the
       wrong password. Not sure.

    <h3>May 3rd, 2020: Finger workout</h3>
    <p>I should've found a different way to insert all that data into MariaDB instead of writing hundreds of queries.
       Oh well. My fingers probably grew some muscles. I had to find a workaround solution for bugs and fish that
       spawn in a non-continuous timeframe. i.e. Spawns in April and October to December. I split them into two columns.
       There's probably a better way to do this. Gotta research.

    <h3>May 1st, 2020: Animal Crossing</h3>
    <p>My goal this month is to create a website where I can filter animal crossing data by month. I'm thinking
       of exploring AWS while doing this project.
